[Critical] <Command> Runtime Command Checking:
           This app is using critical function 'Runtime.getRuntime().exec("...")'.
           Please confirm these following code secions are not harmful:
               => Lcom/wrapper/proxyapplication/Util;->getCPUABI()V (0x28) --->
                    Ljava/lang/Runtime;->exec(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Process;

[Critical]  AndroidManifest ContentProvider Exported Checking:
           Found "exported" ContentProvider, allowing any other app on the device to access it (AndroidManifest.xml). You should modify the
           attribute to [exported="false"] or set at least "signature" protectionalLevel permission if you don't want to.
               Vulnerable ContentProvider Case Example:
                 (1)https://www.nowsecure.com/mobile-security/ebay-android-content-provider-injection-vulnerability.html
                 (2)http://blog.trustlook.com/2013/10/23/ebay-android-content-provider-information-disclosure-vulnerability/
                 (3)http://www.wooyun.org/bugs/wooyun-2010-039169
                 provider => com.facebook.FacebookContentProvider

[Critical]  AndroidManifest ContentProvider Exported Checking:
           We strongly suggest you explicitly specify the "exported" attribute (AndroidManifest.xml).
               For Android "android:targetSdkVersion" < 17, the exported value of ContentProvider is "true" by default.
               For Android "android:targetSdkVersion" >= 17, the exported value of ContentProvider is "false" by default.
               Which means if you do not explicitly set the "android:exported", you will expose your ContentProvider to Android < 4.2
           devices.
               Even if you set the provider the permission with [protectionalLevel="normal"], other apps still cannot access it on Android
           >= 4.2 devices because of the default constraint.
               Please make sure to set exported to "true" if you initially want other apps to use it (including protected by "signature"
           protectionalLevel), and set to "false" if your do not want to.
               Please still specify the "exported" to "true" if you have already set the corresponding "permission", "writePermission" or
           "readPermission" to "signature" protectionLevel or higher
               because other apps signed by the same signature in Android >= 4.2 devices cannot access it.

               Vulnerable ContentProvider Case Example:

[Critical] <Strandhogg> Standhogg 2.0:
           This application is vulnerable to the Standhogg 2.0 vulnerability. Please set activity launchModes to 'singleTask' or

[Critical]  AndroidManifest Critical Use Permission Checking:

               Critical use-permission found: "android.permission.MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS"

[Warning]  AndroidManifest Exported Components Checking:
           Found "exported" components(except for Launcher) for receiving outside applications' actions (AndroidManifest.xml).
               These components can be initilized by other apps. You should add or modify the attribute to [exported="false"] if you don't
           want to.
               You can also protect it with a customized permission with "signature" or higher protectionLevel and specify in
           "android:permission" attribute.
                 activity => com.unity.purchasing.googleplay.VRPurchaseActivity

[Notice]  AndroidManifest Adb Backup Checking:
           ADB Backup is ENABLED for this app (default: ENABLED). ADB Backup is a good tool for backing up all of your files. If it's open

           phone's screen 2.Open the developer mode). The sensitive data may include lifetime access token, username or password, etc.
